          title: 'Fluid pull requests: a new way to safely change code faster!'
          name: Marcelo Sousa
          position: Ceo at Reviewpad

            - AI
          description: Pull requests are the backbone of the DevOps infrastructure across many companies in the industry. In the past year there were over 100 million pull requests created on GitHub alone. However, not every pull request is the same. Still, developers apply the same code review process to every pull request regardless of the author or the changes made. As a result, developers spend most of their time waiting for reviews on pull requests which do not provide any value to the overall code quality. To solve this bottleneck, fluid pull requests are an extension of pull requests with principles from trunk-based development. Developers configure automations in pull requests that allow them to apply different code reviews process depending on the sensitivity of the changes. In this talk, I explain the current problems of pull requests, its impact and how fluid pull requests are helping multiple teams with their pull request workflows.
